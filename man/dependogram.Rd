\value{
A list with the following components:

In the mutual independence case:

\item{norm.RnA}{Supremum norm (Kolmogorov). Test statistic is
\eqn{\|R_{n,A}\|}{||Rna||} and is computed
from the \enc{Möbius}{Mobius} independence half space processes \eqn{R_{n,A}}{RnA}.}

\item{rA}{Critical value of the bootstrap distribution of the test
statistic \eqn{\|R_{n,A}\|}{||Rna||}.}

                                                               p - 1) x B} which contains, for each of the \eqn{B} bootstrap samples, the statistics \code{norm.RnA} for all
subsets \eqn{A} of variables.}

 - 1} - 1) x B} which
contains, for each of the \eqn{B} bootstrap samples, the statistics \code{norm.SnA} for all

\description{
This function can be used for the following two problems:
\enumerate{
\item testing mutual independence between some
numerical random vectors
\item testing for serial independence of a multivariate
stationary quantitative time series.
}

The proposed test does not assume
continuous marginals. It is valid for any probability distribution. It
is also invariant with respect to the affine general linear group of transformations on
the vectors. This test is based on a
characterization of mutual independence defined from probabilities
of half-spaces in a combinatorial formula of Möbius. As such,
it is a natural generalization of tests of independence between
univariate random variables using the empirical distribution
function. Without the assumption that each vector is
one-dimensional with a continuous cumulative distribution
function, any test of independence can not be distribution free.
The critical values of the proposed test are thus computed with
the bootstrap which was shown to be consistent in this context.
